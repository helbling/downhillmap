Downhillmap is a map which visualizes the slopes of paths and streets in Switzerland and Liechtenstein with colors. Red is very steep, white is flat.

The map is based on data available freely from swisstopo: 
- Paths and streets: [swissTLM3d](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/geodata/landscape/tlm3d.html)
- Background: [Vector map (style:Light Base Map)](https://www.geo.admin.ch/en/geo-services/geo-services/portrayal-services-web-mapping/vector_tiles_service.html)

Many thanks to everyone who made the [Open Government Data (OGD) strategy](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/swisstopo/free-geodata.html) possible!
